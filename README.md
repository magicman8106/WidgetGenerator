# WidgetGenerotr

In magento adding widgets for your product pages is tedious and repetative. I made a python program that given a spreadsheet of products to insert into a widget, it reads them
and creates the html content needed to xreate the widget. Using this program instead of copyiong ang pasting 3 different items and have to search them to make sure they are correct. 
You can just copy this one line and paste it
